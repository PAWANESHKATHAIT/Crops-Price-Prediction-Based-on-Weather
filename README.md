Project Description: Commodity Price Prediction Using Real-Time Data
Fluctuations in commodity prices are influenced by various factors, including weather conditions, market trends, and economic activities. This project aims to address the challenges faced by farmers and traders in making informed decisions by developing a real-time commodity price prediction system. By integrating weather data from OpenWeatherMap and historical commodity price data from data.gov.in, the system utilizes machine learning models to provide accurate and up-to-date price forecasts through an interactive web interface.

Objective
The project seeks to analyze and predict commodity prices by leveraging real-time weather data and historical price trends. The system is designed to continuously update predictions, ensuring users receive current insights. Future expansions include mobile application development and language translation capabilities to enhance accessibility for a diverse audience, particularly farmers in rural areas.

System Architecture
The system architecture is composed of several key components:

Data Collection:

Weather Data: Real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and descriptions, is collected from the OpenWeatherMap API.
Commodity Price Data: Historical and real-time price data for agricultural commodities are sourced from data.gov.in.
A Python-based data pipeline automates the collection and integration of these datasets.
Data Pipeline:

The Python schedule library enables regular data fetching (e.g., daily at 8:00 AM).
The pipeline combines historical and real-time data, dynamically updates weather conditions, and determines seasonal factors based on the month.
Prediction Model:

A machine learning model is trained using historical price and weather data. Key variables such as temperature, humidity, and historical price patterns are analyzed to make predictions.
The model is regularly retrained using updated datasets to maintain accuracy and adaptability to current trends.
Web Interface Integration
The user interface is developed using Streamlit, providing an interactive platform where users can input commodity types, locations, and desired time frames to view price forecasts. The interface displays:

Real-time weather data.
Predicted price trends for selected commodities.
Region-specific insights for farmers and traders.
Technology Stack
The project employs a robust technology stack for development and deployment:

Backend: Flask for API integration and web server functionality.
Data Processing: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for model development.
Data Pipeline: Python libraries for job scheduling and API data fetching.
APIs: OpenWeatherMap and data.gov.in for data collection.
Future Scope
The project envisions significant expansions, including:

Mobile Application Development: A cross-platform mobile app (built with Flutter or React Native) for real-time notifications and enhanced accessibility.
Language Translation: Integration of Google Cloud Translation API to support regional languages, making the platform more accessible to non-English-speaking farmers.
Real-Time Crop Data: Incorporating datasets on soil conditions, irrigation levels, and crop health to further refine prediction accuracy.
Conclusion
This project combines the power of machine learning, real-time data integration, and user-friendly web interfaces to deliver a valuable tool for stakeholders in the agricultural sector. By predicting commodity prices based on real-time weather and historical trends, the system empowers users to make informed decisions, reducing uncertainty in the market. With planned future enhancements, the platform aims to become an indispensable resource for the agricultural community.
